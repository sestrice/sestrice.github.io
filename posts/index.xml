      <description>POI&amp;rsquo;s Let me share some random POI’s, locations and ideas to help you in the area. Links in the text below should take you to the map.
How to get to the beach? When you leave the house go to the right (with the house on your back). After two houses there are stairs on the right.
Take the stairs down, cross the street. You will see Pizzeria More on the left.</description>
